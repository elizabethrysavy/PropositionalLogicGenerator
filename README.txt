Propositional Logic Problem Generator

To run the software, save all the files in the project to the same location (the files are listed below). Open the files in a Java IDE (I used IntelliJ IDEA but any IDE should work). To run the software, run the Generator.java file. IMPORTANT: to run the problem validation, Node.js must be installed on your computer. The download for Node.js can be found here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Files in project:
Connector.java
Problem.java
Statement.java
Vars.java
Verify.java
Generator.java
Generator.form
proplog.js

The software used for problem validation was written by Tanel Tammet and edited by Elizabeth Rysavy to suit the needs of the project. The original code can be found here: https://github.com/tammet/logictools and the program can be seen in action here: http://logictools.org/index.html
